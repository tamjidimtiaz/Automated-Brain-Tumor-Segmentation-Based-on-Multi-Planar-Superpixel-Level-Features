The database implemented for this study is MICCAI BRATS-2015 dataset. All of the images are undergoing MRI bias correction and Histogram Matching Algorithm by 3D slicer software. Each of the code has sufficient comments regarding on the process. The code should be executed in the order of their appearances. For a detailed view : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939438

The whole process is carried out on Intel CoreTM i7-8700 3.2 GHz (x12) processor, 8 GB of RAM.

The code is implemented in MATLAB and are not optimized. For any suggestion or query, please give your valuable comment.

You have to download the necessary function regarding of the Extremely Randomized trees (ERT) Classifier Algorithm from matlab.
ERT Code Ref.: 1.https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47372-rtaormina-matlab_extratrees 


gabor orientation selection are implemented based on the algorithm of the following paper:
