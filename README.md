The database implemented for this study is MICCAI BRATS-2015 dataset. Each of the code has sufficient comments regarding on the process. The code is implemented in the order of their appearances. This work is under the review of a journal so informations are not given explicitly. 

The whole process is carried out on Intel CoreTM i7-8700 3.2 GHz (x12) processor, 8 GB of RAM.

The code is implemented in MATLAB and are not optimized. For any suggestion or query, please give your valuable comment.
